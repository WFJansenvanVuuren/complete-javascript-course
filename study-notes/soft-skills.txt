Testing: Unit & integration tests with Jest, Cypress, Playwright.

Mobile: Learn React Native or Expo for mobile apps.

Performance: Core Web Vitals, lazy loading, caching.

AI integrations: Use LLM APIs in real products.Product thinking:

- Can you understand what the user really needs?
- Can you translate fuzzy requirements into clear, testable features?

Architecture & design:

- How will this scale?
- Is it maintainable?
- Where are the bottlenecks?
- AI can suggest patterns — but you decide what fits best.

Communication & collaboration:

- Explaining tech to non-tech people.
- Working with designers, PMs, clients.
- Writing clear docs, tickets, and proposals.
- Giving good code reviews.

Creativity & problem solving:

- Connecting ideas AI can’t see.
- Solving weird bugs, edge cases, messy legacy code.
- Designing delightful UX.

Responsible AI use:

- Knowing when to use AI — and when not to.
- Checking AI-generated code for bugs, bias, security risks.
- Prompt engineering is now a legit skill!
- Master prompt engineering

Learn to leverage AI — smartly:
- Master prompt engineering
- Use tools like GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT to boost productivity — but always review AI code
- Automate repetitive tasks: scaffolding, config, tests

Develop “human” power skills:
- Product thinking: Why does this feature exist? How does it deliver value?
- System design: Basic architecture — how services talk, how data flows, how to scale.
- UX & empathy: Build what users love, not just what you can code.
- Communication: Write clear PRs, docs, and explain complex ideas to non-devs.

Be cloud & deployment fluent:
- Basics of Docker, containers, CI/CD pipelines
- Hosting & scaling on Vercel, Netlify, or AWS
- Monitor & debug production apps

Stay security-conscious:
- Best practices for auth, HTTPS, data validation
- Common vulnerabilities (OWASP basics)
- Secure APIs & user data

Optional but valuable:

- Testing: Unit & integration tests with Jest, Cypress, Playwright.
- Mobile: Learn React Native or Expo for mobile apps.
- Performance: Core Web Vitals, lazy loading, caching.
- AI integrations: Use LLM APIs in real products.
