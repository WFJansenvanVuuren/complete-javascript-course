//Closures
/*
- Closures are not features we explicitly use, we dont create closures manually like a new array or function.
- Closures happen automatically in certain situations.
- a Closure makes a function all the variables that existed at the functions birthplace.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- a Closure is the closed-over variable enviroment of the execution context in thich a function was created, even after that execution context is gone.
  ‚è¨ Less Formal
- a Closure gives a function access to all the variables of its parent function, even after the parent function has returned. The function keeps a reference to its outer scope, which preserves the scope chain throughout time.
  ‚è¨ Less Formal
- a Closure makes sure that a function doesn't loose connection to variables that existed at the fuctions birth place.
  (Functionüßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)-(Connection‚õìÔ∏è)(Parent Scopeüè†)-(Variablesüî†=üî¢)
  ‚è¨ Less Formal
- a Closure is like a backpack/bag that a function carries around whenever it goes. The backpack has all the variables that were present in the environment where the function was created

const secureBooking = function () {
  let passengerCount = 0;

  return function () {
    passengerCount++;
    console.log(`${passengerCount} passenger`);
  };
};

const booker = secureBooking();
booker();
booker();
booker();

//Lets look at the internal property:
console.dir(booker);

//----------------------------------//

//Example 1:
let f;

const g = function () {
  const a = 23;
  f = function () {
    console.log(a * 2);
  };
};

const h = function () {
  const b = 777;
  f = function () {
    console.log(b * 2);
  };
};

g();
f();
console.dir(f);

//f is a different function here because it was re-assigned to h.
h();
f();
console.dir(f);

//Example 2:
const boardPassengers = function (n, wait) {
  const perGroup = n / 3;

  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(`We are now boarding all ${n} passengers`);
    console.log(`There are three groups each with ${perGroup} passengers`);
  }, wait * 1000); //I timer needs 2 paremeters, First a function and second the time, always in miliseconds.

  console.log(`Will start boarding in ${wait} seconds`);
};

const perGroup = 1000;

// Coding Challenge #2

/* 
This is more of a thinking challenge than a coding challenge ü§ì

Take the IIFE below and at the end of the function, attach an event listener that changes the color of the selected h1 element ('header') to blue, each time the BODY element is clicked. Do NOT select the h1 element again!

And now explain to YOURSELF (or someone around you) WHY this worked! Take all the time you need. Think about WHEN exactly the callback function is executed, and what that means for the variables involved in this example.

GOOD LUCK üòÄ


(function () {
  const header = document.querySelector('h1');
  header.style.color = 'red';

  // document.body.addEventListener('click', function () {
  //   header.style.color = 'blue';
  // });

  document.querySelector('body').addEventListener('click', function () {
    header.style.color = 'blue';
  });
})();
*/
/*
Why does this work?

    Variable Scope & Closure:
        - The variable header is defined inside the IIFE, so it's local to the function. However, the event listener callback function, which is defined inside the IIFE, forms a closure.
        - A closure means that the callback function has access to variables from its containing scope (in this case, the IIFE). So even though the callback function is executed later (when the body is clicked), it still has access to the header variable because of this closure.
        - This is why you don‚Äôt need to select the h1 element again inside the event listener. The header variable remains accessible because it was created before the event listener was attached.

    Execution Flow:
        When the page loads, the IIFE runs, and it sets the header color to red immediately.
        Then, the event listener is attached, but the callback function doesn‚Äôt run right away. It only runs when the user clicks the body of the page.
        Once the body is clicked, the callback function executes, and inside it, it accesses the header variable (which is still pointing to the <h1> element) and changes its color to blue.

Why does this solve the challenge?

    - The challenge asks for the callback function to use the same header element and change its color to blue without needing to select the h1 element again inside the callback.
    - The callback function is inside the IIFE, which allows it to have access to the header variable due to closures. The event listener itself is just a mechanism that waits for user interaction (clicks), and it will execute the callback when the event occurs. The important part is that the header element is already selected and stored in a variable before the event listener is set up.

Final thoughts on the "why":

    - When the IIFE runs, it sets up the necessary state (like selecting the header and setting its color to red).
    - The event listener doesn't need to re-select the header because it's already available within the scope of the callback function, thanks to closure.
    - The callback function reacts to the event (click on the body) and modifies the color of the header, using the header variable that was defined earlier in the function.

It's a cool example of how closures allow us to retain access to variables even after the scope where they were defined has finished executing!

///////////////////////////////////////////////
//Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)
//We use this if we want to create a function that will execute immediately and only run once and never again.

(function () {
  console.log('This will never run again!');
  const isPrivate = 23
})();
//We wrap the function in parenthesis to form an expression

//The same would work for an arrow function:
(() => console.log('This will ALSO never run again!'))();

//This allows us to protect out data and variables from being overwritten and keep variables private and contained within the inner scopes and the global scope does not have access to this.
//This means that this data is encapsulated.
//isPrivate in encapsulated within the scope of that function which will only run once. Protecting the data from being accessed again.
//It is important to hide variables and scopes are a good tool for doing this.

//Variables declared with let or const create there own scopes inside a block, var would be accessable

{
  const isPrivate = 23
}
//For data privacy we would just create a block instead of a function

//Coding Challenge #1

/* 
Let's build a simple poll app!

A poll has a question, an array of options from which people can choose, and an array with the number of replies for each option. This data is stored in the starter object below.

Here are your tasks:

1. Create a method called 'registerNewAnswer' on the 'poll' object. The method does 2 things:
  1.1. Display a prompt window for the user to input the number of the selected option. The prompt should look like this:
        What is your favourite programming language?
        0: JavaScript
        1: Python
        2: Rust
        3: C++
        (Write option number)
  
  1.2. Based on the input number, update the answers array. For example, if the option is 3, increase the value AT POSITION 3 of the array by 1. Make sure to check if the input is a number and if the number makes sense (e.g answer 52 wouldn't make sense, right?)
2. Call this method whenever the user clicks the "Answer poll" button.
3. Create a method 'displayResults' which displays the poll results. The method takes a string as an input (called 'type'), which can be either 'string' or 'array'. If type is 'array', simply display the results array as it is, using console.log(). This should be the default option. If type is 'string', display a string like "Poll results are 13, 2, 4, 1". 
4. Run the 'displayResults' method at the end of each 'registerNewAnswer' method call.

HINT: Use many of the tools you learned about in this and the last section üòâ

BONUS: Use the 'displayResults' method to display the 2 arrays in the test data. Use both the 'array' and the 'string' option. Do NOT put the arrays in the poll object! So what shoud the this keyword look like in this situation?

BONUS TEST DATA 1: [5, 2, 3]
BONUS TEST DATA 2: [1, 5, 3, 9, 6, 1]

GOOD LUCK üòÄ

const poll = {
  question: 'What is your favourite programming language?',

//   } else {
//     console.log('Incorrect input');
//   }

poll.displayResults.call({ answers: [5, 2, 3] }, 'string'); //we create a new object called answers
poll.displayResults.call({ answers: [1, 5, 3, 9, 6, 1] }); //we create a new object called answers
*/

//Note: Your code seems correct overall, but there‚Äôs one potential issue that could be causing your array (poll.answers) not to update: the asynchronous nature of prompt and the console.log(poll.answers) placement.
// Here's a breakdown of what's happening:

// Prompt and user input: The registerNewAnswer method prompts the user to select an option, and updates the corresponding answer count based on the user‚Äôs input.

// The issue: The line console.log(poll.answers) runs immediately after the event listener is set, before any user interaction takes place. Therefore, it logs the initial state of poll.answers, which is [0, 0, 0, 0].

  airline: 'Lusfthansa',
  iataCode: 'LH',
  bookings: [],
  book(flightNum, name) {
    //Writing methods using enhanced object literal syntax,before this we used to do it this way:book:function(){},(Object method)
    console.log(
      `${name} booked a seat on ${this.airline} flight ${this.iataCode}${flightNum}`
    );
    this.bookings.push({ flight: `${this.iataCode}${flightNum}`, name });
  },
};

lufthansa.book(239, 'Jonas Schmedt');
lufthansa.book(635, 'Mike Smith');
const eurowings = {
  airline: 'Eurowings',
  iataCode: 'EW',
  bookings: [],
};

const book = lufthansa.book; //Creating a new function so that we can reuse the existing 'book' function in the lufthansa object.
// book(23, 'Sarah Williams')// Will return 'undefined' because the 'this' keyword no longer points to the object(lufthansa).

//So we can fix this by using 3 function methods:
//1. Call Method:
book.call(eurowings, 23, 'Sarah Williams'); //In the call method the first argument is what we want the 'this' keyword to point to.
//üëÜHere we did not call the book method, but the call function that called the book method with the this keyword set to eurowings.
console.log(eurowings);
book.call(lufthansa, 239, 'Mary Cooper');
console.log(lufthansa);

const swiss = {
  airline: 'Swiss',
  iataCode: 'LX',
  bookings: [],
};

book.call(swiss, 583, 'Mary Cooper');
console.log(swiss);

//2. Apply Method:
//The apply method does exactly the same thing but it does not receive an argument after the 'this' keyword, but instead it takes an Array of the arguments:
const flightData = [583, 'George Cooper'];
book.apply(swiss, flightData);
console.log(swiss);
//The apply method is not used so much in modern JavaScript anymore because we have a better way of doing it now:

//3.The Bind Method:
//The bind method does not immediately call the function, instead it returns a new function where the 'this' keyword is bound.
//It is set to whatever value we pass into bind.

const bookLX = book.bind(swiss);
const bookLH = book.bind(lufthansa);
const bookEW = book.bind(eurowings); //This will not call the book function, instead it return a new function where the 'this' keyword wil always be set to eurowings. Instead of using the call method all the time we can now just use these functions.
bookEW(23, 'Steven Williams');

//In the call method we can pass multiple arguments except for the 'this' keyword.
//We can do the same with the bind method and then these will be defined, so the function will then always be called with these same arguments. Allows us to set in stone certain arguments so resulting arguments can become even simpler.

//Now the flight number is preset and we just need to pass in the name. If we change the number 23 to say 1234, then those flights will be booked to that flight number.Specifying parts of the argumets beforehand is called partial application.(a Part of the argument of the orginal function is already applied/set)
const bookEW23 = book.bind(eurowings, 23);
bookEW23('Jonas Schmedt');
bookEW23('Martha Cooper');

//We can also use this method where we use objects together with event listeners:
lufthansa.planes = 300;
lufthansa.buyPlane = function () {
  console.log(this);

  this.planes++;
  console.log(this.planes);
};

document.querySelector('.buy').addEventListener('click', lufthansa.buyPlane);
//When we click on the button we get NaN.
//The reason is because the 'this' keyword is the button element('.buy')
//This is because in an 'eventhandler' function the 'this' keyword always pionts to the elements on which that handler is attached, in this case it is attached to 'document.querySelector('.buy')/the button elemant'.

//This means we need to manually define the this keyword using the bind method:
document
  .querySelector('.buy')
  .addEventListener('click', lufthansa.buyPlane.bind(lufthansa));

//Partial application(Preset parameters)

const addTax = (rate, value) => value + value * rate;
console.log(addTax(0.1, 200));
//We use null because there is no 'this' keyword.
const addVAT = addTax.bind(null, 0.23);
//This would be the same as writing:
// addTax = value => value + value * 0.23;

console.log(addVAT(100));

//Rewrite this using the tecnique of one function returning another function:

const addTaxRate = function (rate) {
  return function (value) {
    console.log(value + value * rate);
  };
};

addTaxRate(0.23)(100);

//Other Way:
const addTaxRate2 = function (rate) {
  return function (value) {
    return value + value * rate;
